            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Skye (they/them). I am currently working as an AI Researcher
              on the Smart Behaviors team at <a
                href="https://piaggiofastforward.com/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Piaggio Fast Forward</a
              >. Here are a few of my passions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Computer science has a lot of domains I really enjoy such as: <u
                  >Machine Learning</u
                >, <u>Reinforcement Learning</u>, <u>Systems Architecture</u>,
                and <u>Data Analysis</u>. Lower level programming has been a recent
                interest of mine as well, playing around with <b>C</b> for operating
                systems and embedded systems. Human Robotic Interaction is another
                field I find really interesting!
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Neuroscience has been a big passion of mine for many years.
                Human behavior is fascinating to me, and I love learning about how
                the brain works and how we can apply that to technology like robotics.
                Although I enjoy learning about the genetic aspects of neuroscience as well.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Video games have been a part of my life for over 15 years! I've
                continued to keep playing and keep up with my favorite
                franchises along with also experimenting on many new ones. I've
                developed my own games both for class work and for game jams and
                wish to continue to do so!
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                I've been in a few labs during my time at school, including an HCI Privacy lab,
                a Performance Systems lab, and a Computational Neuroscience lab. I've enjoyed
                working on research projects in these labs and collaborating with other students
                and professors.
